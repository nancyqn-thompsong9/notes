- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors. First, identify the most important tasks and focus on them first. By prioritizing your tasks this way, you can ensure that you are making progress on the right things.

Secondly, use time management techniques to your advantage. Break down your projects into smaller, manageable tasks. Then, allocate time for each task, allowing for some wiggle room in case things take longer than expected. Using a scheduling tool like Todoist or Trello can help keep you organized and on track. 
 	
Lastly, stay organised and don't be afraid to ask for help. Keep your code organized, using version control like Git to track your changes. Document your work, so others can understand your thinking and code. If you get stuck on a problem, don’t hesitate to reach out to colleagues, friends, or online communities like Stack Overflow for assistance. Remember, there is always someone willing to help, provided you put in the effort to communicate your issue clearly.

- "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth. 

Focus on writing clean, readable code first and optimize only when necessary. Complicated optimizations can often make code harder to understand and maintain, leading to more bugs and difficulties in the long run. It's better to have working software that can be easily modified and improved than to waste time optimizing something that may not even be a bottleneck.
